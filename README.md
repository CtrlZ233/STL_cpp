# STL_cpp
This is an exercise for personal learningï¼Œ and realize basic STL components and functions based on c++. Many features are not complete, and if any question, welcome to contact me:328825619@qq.com

# Vector Class:
The method my Vecotr class supported:
```bash
begin():                    return a iterator point the start pointer.
end():                      return a iterator point the end pointer.
size():                     return the size of vector.
max_size():                 return the max size of vector.
operator[]:                 return the element using index iterator.
at():                       return the element using index iterator.
front():                    return the first element.
back():                     return the last element.
push_back():                insert a new element to the last.
pop_back():                 delete the last element.
earse():                    delete some elements.
insert():                   insert a new element to somewhere.
empty():                    return true if vector is empty.
clear():                    clear the vector.
print_all_elem():           print all elements in vector.
